# PCA Asset Weights Comparison

This folder provides Python code for comparing the weights associated with assets generated during the creation of the DHS WI. This compares the original DHS WI asset weights with the gender specific DHS WI asset weights.

To run this yourself, simply replace the values of the `base_path` variable in `weights_comparison.py` with the path to the `equitable-ai` folder of this repo on your system.

Note: running this yourself will replace the outputs currently provided in this folder.
