# Predictions

This folder provides Python code to load a specific trained model and then run all 2014 Ghana DHS households through the model to estimate their wealth.

To run this yourself, simply replace the value of the `base_path` variable in `predictions.py` with the path to the repo on your system.

Note: running this yourself will replace the outputs currently provided in this folder.
